My repository for the AoC 2021. This is my first year taking the challenge.

My goal is to solve the problems and take some notes of my mistakes. I am not trying to be "efficient". However, I like to add a bit of generallization if possible, and I often try to reuse code between parts of the problems.

That is all, thanks for reading!
